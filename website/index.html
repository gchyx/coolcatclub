					<h3><b>Lucina</b></h3>
					<img src="lucina.png" width="400px"><br>
						<p2><i>Lucina was never alone anymore</i></p2>
							<br><br>
						<p3>At first, I thought The Cool Cats was one of those anonymous, social site that you see on google
							<br> but when I began to get more indulged with it, it took me to a whole new level. I even made some new friends from it!
							<br> Now we go to the Kitty Market every Sunday morning. I'll never be alone again thanks to the Cool Cats Club!</p3>
				</div>  
				<br><br>
				<div>
					<h3><b>The Moriah Twins</b></h3>
					<img src="moriahtwins.png" width="400px"><br>
						<p4><i>The creepy twins have found their place!</i></p4>
							<br><br>
						<p5>Other cats have always thought we were creepy, so we never really had the chance to meet many cat friends.
							<br> However, thanks to the Cool Cats Club, we found many other cats that were just like us!</p5>

				</div> 
				<br><br>
				<div>
					<h3><b>Kira</b></h3>
					<img src="Kira.png" width="400px"><br>
						<p6><i>The pick-me-up cat that we all hate has made even more "boyfwrends"...
							<br>Let's see how many kittens she will have in the next two years!</i></p6>
							<br><br>
						I <p7>can't thank the Cool Cats Club enough! I've always had many kitty boyfwrends but it was my dream to have more
							<br> and more of them! Now, I've made so many of them it's hard to count anymore! I have so many boyfwrends
							<br> texting me everyday, it's tiring but so grateful!</p7>
				</div> 
				<br><br>
				<div>
					<h3><b>Hunter</b></h3>
					<img src="Hunter.png" width="400px"><br>
						<p8><i>Hunter has finally found the girl of his dreams.
							<br>We wish all the best to Angel <span>&#128591;&#127996;</span></i></p8>
							<br><br>
						<p9>It's dope I guess. I never truly wanted to fall in love until I met this one-of-a-kind kitty girl.
							<br> Boy, she's the cat's meow. The only one in my heart. My darling Angel is the only one in my heart now.
							<br> No other kitty girls will have my attention at all.</p9>
				</div> 
				<br>
				<div>
					<h3><b>Robertson</b></h3>
					<img src="Robertson.png" width="400px"><br>
						<p10><i>Aww Robertson... we're glad you found your cats!</i></p10>
							<br><br>
						<p11>t can get a little lonely especially when you're a financial broker in KittyBank Coperates. Sometimes I come here
							<br> to meet new friends and I find many like me who are stressed out and lonely in the financial world. I'm truly
							<br> thankful for websites such as this to help others like me keep my sanity.</p11>
